# testing-practice
This project was about learning and practicing how to program using TDD (Test Driven Development). In this project there are several functions that perform simple tasks. These tasks include creating a calculator object that performs simple arithmatic, string manipulation, and array mutation. The main purpose was to test these functions and make them pass the tests.
## What I learned

I learned how to triangulate my programming. I wrote the test first, then coded the function by any means necessary. I would then refactor the code to get the right kind of functionality. I also learned about the different match cases I can use with Jest. I more specifically learned how I can use the "equalTo" case for matching a returned object. I also learned how to use the ".test" method with a regex pattern when doing the caesar cipher on a string without touching the non-letter symbols. 

## Obstacles

The biggest obstacle from this project was the caesar cipher. More specifically -- the special symbols in the string input. I did not know about the .test method which led me to make a really complicated helper function that made the code unreadable and, quite frankly, broken. Once I found out about the method, I refactored and turned the code into a readable and more functional program.
